### Overview

This is my attempt at solving the [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) problems in OCaml.

### Prerequisites

- [OCaml](https://ocaml.org/)
- [Dune](https://dune.build/)

### How to run

```shell
dune exec aoc <YEAR> <DAY> [--stdin]
```

> [!WARNING]
> The `--stdin` flag is not supported by most puzzles and will ignore the input.
